I have been dedicated to domestic social policy at all levels of government since 2006. Originally from Baltimore City, I've cultivated a blend of policy, data and advocacy, and community engagement skills throughout my career.

I began my career in Governor O’Malley’s StateStat Office, advancing progress toward statewide economic opportunity and health policy goals. In 2012, I went on to serve as Director of the Baltimore City Partnership to End Childhood Hunger, leading a coalition of public and private actors in planning and implementing evidence-based strategies to eradicate hunger and improve family stability. I joined the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University in April 2015.

In my free time, I teach yoga at a residential rehabilitation facility, am an avid runner, and enjoy watching professional wrestling.
