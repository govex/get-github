## How to Github for GovEx.

Slides based on [Richard Dunks](http://www.datapolitan.com)' [Mining The Web](http://www.datapolitan.com/MiningTheWeb/class2/) class at Pratt

### Quick and dirty:

#### When starting from scratch (in Github desktop):

+ Clone your repo -- remember where you've saved it locally
+ Create a branch for yourself. Naming convention is (currently; subject to change): YYYYMMDD-name-task/feature
+ **Make sure you change to your branch**
+ Make your changes
+ Commit your changes
+ Push (sync, in the desktop app) your changes to the repo
+ Submit a pull request. Someone will +1 or merge your pull request.

#### When working on a repo you've already cloned (you should create a new branch every time):

+ Change to master branch
+ Pull or sync changes
+ Create a new branch, and change to it.
+ Make your changes
+ Commit your changes
+ Push (sync, in the desktop app) your changes to the repo
+ Submit a pull request. Someone will +1 or merge your pull request. 

#### Some things to remember:

+ Commit often!
+ Whenever it makes sense, push your changes and make a pull request. **This is especially true if you're going to stop working on a repo for more than an hour.**
+ **Don't** work directly on master, or push to master.
