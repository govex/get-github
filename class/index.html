###_When you're ready_, Publish!

---

class:center,middle
#Get going in Desktop
###Create a pull request
![img-full](../images/pull_request.png)

---

class:center,middle
#That's it! 
###Someone will review your contribution, approve, and merge the pull request. (Or bounce it back to you for changes).

---

#What's next?

+ You can continue to make changes on that same branch until your PR is merged. 
+ When your PR is merged, your branch will be deleted. It's good practice to always sync your repo before you start work.
